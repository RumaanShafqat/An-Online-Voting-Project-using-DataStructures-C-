INTRODUCTION TO MY PROJECT:
MY PROJECT IS online voting system .  
online voting system is an advance software which can benefit our country and internationally also. 
I created my project by using data structures .this report will find a way to how by using c++ data structures I made this online voting system.

Linked list data structure:
A linked list is the most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. 
A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field,
the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.
I use linked list in my project for creating nodes for candidates.
the reason behind choosing link list is that we can create unlimited nodes and also assigning large number of 
candidates required usage of data structure which is more efficient in both time and space point of view.
